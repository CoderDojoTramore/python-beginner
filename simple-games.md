# CoderDojo Tramore - Simple Games in Python

This week we’re going to build on the python we’ve learned so far to create some simple games:

1. ‘heads or tails’ game: make a simple heads or tails game. Keep count of the score as the user plays. This is very similar to games we’ve already done. Hints:

* use Random(0,1) where heads is 0, tails is 1
* use variables to keep track of scores outside the main loop

2. Write a program that will generate numbers for the lotto!

3. Write some simple dice games. Some ideas:

* user has to roll 3 or over to keep playing - keep a high score on this one
* play against the computer - you roll a dice, computer rolls a dice, see who wins. Keep two scores for this one

For all these games:

* try use python functions to keep your code clean and logical
* remember to use the debugger if your code doesn’t work!
* reference code in other programs we've already written
* reference the 'Invent with python' book also!
