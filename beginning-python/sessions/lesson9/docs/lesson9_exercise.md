Beginning Python: Lesson 9
=================



###*Exercises*
In this lesson we'll try a few challanges based on what we've covered so far:

1. **‘heads or tails’ game: **make a simple heads or tails game. Keep count of the score as the user plays. This is very similar to games we’ve already done. Hints:
	-  use Random(0,1) where heads is 0, tails is 1
	- use variables to keep track of scores outside the main loop

2. **Draw a house:** Using Turtle, draw a house that looks like this:

3. Write some simple dice games. Some ideas:
	- user has to roll 3 or over to keep playing - keep a high score on this one
	- play against the computer - you roll a dice, computer rolls a dice, see who wins. Keep two scores for this one

4. Rock, paper, scissors: Write a rock paper scissors game where you play against the computer. Keep two scores, one for you and one for the computer.

For all these games:

* try use python functions to keep your code clean and logical
* remember to use the debugger if your code doesn’t work!
* reference code in other programs we've already written
